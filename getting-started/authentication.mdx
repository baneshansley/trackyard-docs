Trackyard uses API keys for authentication. Every request to the API must include a valid API key in the `Authorization` header.

---

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Go to [app.trackyard.com](https://app.trackyard.com) and sign in.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Click **API Keys** in the dashboard or visit [app.trackyard.com/api-keys](https://app.trackyard.com/api-keys).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate a new key">
    Click **Create API Key**, give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production App" or "Testing"), and save the key immediately.
    
    <Warning>
      **The key is shown only once.** Copy it to a secure location immediately. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request using the `Bearer` token scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKYARD_API_KEY"
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store keys in environment variables" icon="lock">
    **Never hardcode API keys in your source code.** Use environment variables instead.
    
    ```bash
    # .env file (add to .gitignore!)
    TRACKYARD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    
    ```python
    # Python
    import os
    API_KEY = os.environ["TRACKYARD_API_KEY"]
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    // Node.js
    const API_KEY = process.env.TRACKYARD_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for different environments" icon="code-branch">
    Create distinct API keys for development, staging, and production environments. This allows you to:
    
    - Revoke a compromised key without affecting other environments
    - Monitor usage separately per environment
    - Enforce different rate limits if needed
    
    **Naming convention:**
    - `Production - Main App`
    - `Staging - Test Environment`
    - `Development - Local Testing`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    As a security best practice, rotate your API keys periodically (every 90 days recommended):
    
    1. Generate a new API key
    2. Update your application to use the new key
    3. Test that the new key works
    4. Revoke the old key
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Restrict key permissions (coming soon)" icon="shield">
    Future feature: Assign read-only or download-only permissions to specific keys for added security.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing API Keys

### View All Keys

In your [API Keys dashboard](https://app.trackyard.com/api-keys), you can see:

- **Key name** — The label you assigned
- **Created date** — When the key was generated
- **Last used** — Most recent API call timestamp
- **Status** — Active or revoked

### Revoke a Key

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Go to [app.trackyard.com/api-keys](https://app.trackyard.com/api-keys)
2. Find the key in the list
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  **Revoking a key is immediate and irreversible.** All applications using that key will stop working instantly. Make sure you've updated your code to use a new key first.
</Warning>

## API Key Metadata

Use the `/me` endpoint to check your key's metadata:

```bash
curl https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKYARD_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "tier": "free",
  "credits_remaining": 487,
  "monthly_allowance": 500,
  "rate_limit": {
    "requests_per_minute": 10,
    "requests_per_day": 1000
  },
  "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "last_used_at": "2026-02-20T14:22:15Z"
}
```

## Common Authentication Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Cause:** Missing, invalid, or expired API key.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check that your key is correct (no extra spaces or characters)
    - Verify the `Authorization: Bearer` format
    - Ensure the key hasn't been revoked
    - Generate a new key if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden" icon="ban">
    **Cause:** API key is valid but lacks permissions for the requested action.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check your account tier (some features require paid plans)
    - Verify you're not trying to access admin-only endpoints
  </Accordion>
