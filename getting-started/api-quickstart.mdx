This guide walks you through the complete workflow: from account creation to downloading a licensed track via the Trackyard API.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Trackyard account ([sign up here](https://app.trackyard.com))
- Basic familiarity with REST APIs

---

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up or log in">
    Go to [app.trackyard.com](https://app.trackyard.com) and create a free account or log in.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Click on **API Keys** in the dashboard or go directly to [app.trackyard.com/api-keys](https://app.trackyard.com/api-keys).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click **Create API Key**, give it a name (e.g., "My First Key"), and copy the key to your clipboard.
    
    <Warning>
      **Keep your API key secure!** Never commit it to version control or share it publicly. Store it in environment variables.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

```bash
# Store your API key in an environment variable
export TRACKYARD_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

---

## Step 2: Search for Music

Use the `/search` endpoint to find tracks. Describe what you need in plain English — Trackyard's AI will infer genre, mood, BPM, and instrumentation automatically.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKYARD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "upbeat electronic music for tech startup video",
    "limit": 5,
    "filters": {
      "has_vocals": false
    }
  }'
```

<Accordion title="Example Response">
```json
{
  "tracks": [
    {
      "id": "trk_abc123",
      "title": "Digital Sunrise",
      "artist": "Sync Lab",
      "duration_seconds": 142,
      "bpm": 128,
      "key": "C Major",
      "genres": ["Electronic", "Corporate"],
      "moods": ["Upbeat", "Energetic", "Modern"],
      "has_vocals": false,
      "preview_url": "https://cdn.trackyard.com/previews/trk_abc123.mp3"
    },
    // ... 4 more tracks
  ],
  "credits_remaining": 487
}
```
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** The more specific your query, the better the results. Try "moody lo-fi piano for a coffee shop vlog" instead of just "lofi music."
</Tip>

## Step 3: Download a Licensed Track

Once you've found a track you like, use the `/download-track` endpoint to get the audio file. The license is automatically included — no extra step required.

### Option A: Download Full Track

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/download-track \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKYARD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"track_id": "trk_abc123"}' \
  --output track.mp3
```

### Option B: Download Smart-Trimmed Clip

Need exactly 30 seconds? Trackyard analyzes the waveform and selects the best-sounding segment automatically.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/download-track \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKYARD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "track_id": "trk_abc123",
    "duration_seconds": 30
  }' \
  --output clip-30s.mp3
```

### Option C: Align Musical Peak to Specific Offset

Want the big hit to land at exactly 12 seconds (e.g., when your product appears on screen)?

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/download-track \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRACKYARD_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "track_id": "trk_abc123",
    "duration_seconds": 22,
    "hit_point_seconds": 12
  }' \
  --output clip-with-hit.mp3
```

<Info>
  **How it works:** Trackyard's algorithm finds the dominant energy peak in the track and aligns it to your specified offset. Perfect for syncing music to video reveals, product shots, or title cards.

## Step 4: Use the Track

That's it! You now have a licensed MP3 file ready to use in your project. The license is perpetual — use it forever with no renewals or expiration.

  - ✅ Perpetual usage rights (no expiration)
  - ✅ Social media (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
