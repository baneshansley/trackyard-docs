## For Music Supervisors

<Card title="Web App (Coming Soon)" icon="film" color="#EC8D28">
  **Browse, shortlist, and license music** through a purpose-built interface designed for production workflows.
  
  **Features:**
  - Visual catalog browsing with audio previews
  - Project-based organization (longlist → shortlist → licensed)
  - Team collaboration and shared shortlists
  - Instant licensing with auto-generated paperwork
  - Transparent, upfront pricing
  
  **Status:** In active development. API access is available now for developers building custom workflows.
</Card>

### What You Can Do Today

While the web app is in development, you can:

1. **Use the API directly** — If you're comfortable with technical tools, get an API key and search/download tracks via command-line tools
2. **Request early access** — Email support@trackyard.com to join the waitlist for the web app beta
3. **Explore via MCP** — If you use Claude or other AI agents, install the Trackyard MCP server for conversational music search
