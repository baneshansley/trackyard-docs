Download a licensed track as an MP3 file. Optionally request a smart-trimmed clip with automatic segment selection and hit point alignment.

**Cost:** 1 credit per request

**License:** Perpetual sync license included automatically. No additional step required.

---

## Authentication

All requests require a valid API key in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

---

## Request Body

<ParamField path="track_id" type="string" required>
  The track ID from search results.
  
  **Example:** `"trk_abc123"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="duration_seconds" type="number">
  Clip length in seconds. Omit this field to download the full track.
  
  When specified, Trackyard analyzes the waveform and selects the best-sounding segment automatically.
  
  **Range:** 10-300 seconds
  **Recommended minimum:** 10 seconds (shorter clips may lack musical coherence)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="hit_point_seconds" type="number">
  Offset (in seconds) where the musical peak should land. **Requires `duration_seconds`.**
  
  The algorithm finds the dominant energy peak in the track and aligns it to this offset.

  **Range:** Must be less than `duration_seconds`
  **Precision:** ±1 second

## How Smart Trimming Works

When you specify `duration_seconds`, Trackyard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyzes the waveform">
    Scans the entire track for musical phrases, energy peaks, beat alignment, and tonal consistency.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scores possible segments">
    Every potential clip is scored based on musical coherence, energy distribution, and start/end quality.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Selects the best segment">
    Returns the highest-scoring segment as a clean MP3 with no fade-outs or awkward cuts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Use Smart Trimming

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Perfect For">
    ✅ **Short-form content** — Instagram Reels, TikToks, YouTube Shorts
    
    ✅ **Ads** — Social media ads, pre-roll, mid-roll
    
    ✅ **Product demos** — SaaS walkthroughs, unboxing videos
    
    ✅ **Trailers** — App, game, or film trailers
    
    ✅ **Batch processing** — Auto-scoring 100+ videos at scale
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Skip It">
    ❌ **Long-form content** — Podcasts, full episodes, feature films
    
    ❌ **Custom edits** — When you need frame-perfect control

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Hit Point Alignment

The `hit_point_seconds` parameter choreographs the music's peak to a specific moment in your video.

### Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Product Reveal" icon="box">
    **Scenario:** 15-second Instagram Reel, product appears at 8 seconds
    
    **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "track_id": "trk_xyz789",
      "duration_seconds": 15,
      "hit_point_seconds": 8
    }
    ```
    
    **Result:** Music peaks right when the product enters the frame.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Logo Drop" icon="circle">
    **Scenario:** 30-second YouTube ad, logo reveals at 22 seconds

    {
      "track_id": "trk_def456",
      "duration_seconds": 30,
      "hit_point_seconds": 22
    }
    ```
    
    **Result:** Musical peak aligns with the logo for maximum impact.
  </Accordion>

      "duration_seconds": 45,
      "hit_point_seconds": 35
    }
    ```
    
    **Result:** Music builds throughout, peaks at the title card.

## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
  **Preview first:** Use the `preview_url` from search results to audition tracks before downloading
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Choose tracks with clear peaks:** Electronic drops, orchestral crescendos, and hip hop hits work best for hit point alignment
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test different durations:** If a 30-second clip doesn't sound right, try 28 or 32 seconds for better segment selection
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Align hit points to visual moments:** Product reveals, logo drops, title cards, scene transitions
</Tip>
