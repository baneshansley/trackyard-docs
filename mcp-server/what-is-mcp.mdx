title: "What is MCP?"
description: "Introduction to the Model Context Protocol and how it works with Trackyard"
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI agents like Claude and Cursor access external tools and data sources. Trackyard's MCP server gives AI agents direct access to the music catalog.

---

## How It Works

Instead of calling the Trackyard API manually, you describe what you need in natural language to your AI agent:

**You:** "Find me upbeat music for a 30-second Instagram Reel about travel"

**Claude (via MCP):**
1. Searches Trackyard's catalog
2. Presents top results
3. Downloads the track when you confirm
4. Trims it to exactly 30 seconds

All in one conversation. Zero code.

## Why Use MCP Instead of the REST API?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MCP Server (Conversational)">
    **Best for:** Non-technical users, quick one-off searches, exploratory workflows
    
    **How it works:**
    - Talk to Claude/Cursor in plain English
    - The AI calls the Trackyard API for you
    - You confirm selections and the AI downloads tracks
    
    **Example workflow:**
    ```
    You: "I need music for a 15-second product video"
    AI: "What kind of vibe?"
    You: "Upbeat and modern, no vocals"
    AI: [searches, presents 3 options]
    You: "Download the second one"
    AI: [downloads and saves the file]
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="REST API (Programmatic)">
    **Best for:** Automation, pipelines, batch processing, custom integrations
    
    **How it works:**
    - Write code to call Trackyard endpoints
    - Integrate into your existing workflows
    - Automate hundreds/thousands of requests
    
    **Example workflow:**
    ```python
    tracks = search("upbeat music")
    audio = download(tracks[0]["id"], duration_seconds=15)
    save("product_video_music.mp3", audio)
    ```
  </Tab>

## What You Can Do With MCP

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search by natural language" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Example:**
    
    "Find me chill lo-fi music for a coding stream"
    
    **What happens:** The AI searches Trackyard, interprets your intent, and presents relevant tracks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Download with smart trimming" icon="scissors">
    **Example:**
    
    "Download that second track as a 30-second clip"
    
    **What happens:** The AI calls `/download-track` with `duration_seconds: 30` and saves the file locally.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Align hit points" icon="bullseye">
    **Example:**
    
    "Trim it to 22 seconds with the big hit at 12 seconds"
    
    **What happens:** The AI uses `hit_point_seconds: 12` to align the musical peak.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch operations" icon="layer-group">
    **Example:**
    
    "Find 5 different tracks for travel videos and download 15-second clips of each"
    
    **What happens:** The AI searches once, then downloads 5 custom clips.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Use MCP vs. API

**Use MCP when:**
- You want conversational music discovery
- You're doing one-off searches (not automation)
- You prefer natural language over code
- You're using Claude, Cursor, or another MCP-compatible agent

**Use the REST API when:**
- You're building automation or pipelines
- You need to process hundreds/thousands of requests
- You're integrating into your own application
- You want full programmatic control
