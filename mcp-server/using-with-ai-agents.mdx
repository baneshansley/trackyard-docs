## Tips for Best Results

<Tip>
  **Be specific:** "upbeat electronic for tech demo" > "upbeat music"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Mention the use case:** Context helps the AI infer genre, mood, and energy
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Ask for previews:** "Show me previews first" lets you audition before downloading
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use natural language:** The AI understands "the big hit should land at 12 seconds" without technical jargon
</Tip>

## What the MCP Server Can Do

The Trackyard MCP server exposes these capabilities to AI agents:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Natural language queries with optional filters (genre, mood, BPM, vocals, energy)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Download Full Tracks" icon="download">
    Get the complete audio file with perpetual license
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Smart Trimming" icon="scissors">

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Credit consumption:** Each search and download consumes credits, just like the REST API. The AI will warn you when credits are low.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Rate limits apply:** The MCP server is subject to the same rate limits as direct API calls (10 req/min on free tier).
</Warning>
