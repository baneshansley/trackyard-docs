**OpenClaw** is an AI assistant platform that lets you build workflows and automate tasks using natural language. The Trackyard skill gives OpenClaw direct access to search and download music from the catalog.

---

## How It Works

Instead of writing code, you describe what you want in plain English to your OpenClaw bot:

**You:** "Find upbeat music for a 30-second Instagram Reel about travel and download it"

**OpenClaw:**
1. Searches Trackyard using the Trackyard skill
2. Presents results
3. Downloads the track when you confirm
4. Saves it to your specified location

All conversational. Zero code.

## Trackyard Skill vs. Direct API

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Trackyard Skill (No-Code)">
    **Best for:** Non-technical users, automated workflows, batch operations
    
    **How it works:**
    - Talk to OpenClaw in plain English
    - The skill calls the Trackyard API for you
    - Automate complex workflows (video generation + music + uploading)
    
    **Example workflow:**
    ```
    "Every Monday and Wednesday:
    1. Generate 5 video ideas about travel
    2. Find stock images at Pexels
    3. Stitch them together
    4. Add script with subtitles
    5. Search Trackyard for relevant music
    6. Save videos to Google Drive"
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Direct API (Programmatic)">
    **Best for:** Custom integrations, your own applications
    
    **How it works:**
    - Write code to call Trackyard endpoints
    - Full control over parameters
    - Integrate into existing codebases
    
    **Example workflow:**
    ```python
    tracks = search("upbeat music")
    audio = download(tracks[0]["id"], duration_seconds=30)
    save("music.mp3", audio)
    ```
  </Tab>

## OpenClaw vs. MCP

Both let you use Trackyard without code, but they work differently:

| Feature | OpenClaw Skill | MCP Server |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Platform** | OpenClaw only | Claude, Cursor, any MCP-compatible agent |
| **How it works** | Uses Trackyard API via skill | Uses Trackyard API via MCP protocol |
| **Best for** | Automation, workflows, scheduling | Conversational music search in AI tools |
| **Setup** | Install skill from ClawHub | Configure MCP server in agent settings |
