The Trackyard skill shines when combined with other OpenClaw skills to build end-to-end automated workflows. Here are real-world examples.

---

## Automated Social Media Content Farm

The most powerful use case: fully automated video creation with music.

### The Workflow

"Every Monday and Wednesday at 9am:
1. Generate 5 video ideas about travel destinations
2. Find stock images at Pexels for each destination
3. Stitch images together into 15-second videos
4. Add a script with subtitles
5. Search Trackyard for upbeat travel music
6. Add the music to each video
7. Save the final videos to my Google Drive"

### What OpenClaw Does

1. **Generates ideas** — Uses AI to create 5 travel destination concepts
2. **Finds images** — Searches Pexels API for relevant stock photos
3. **Creates videos** — Stitches images together (using ffmpeg or similar)
4. **Adds scripts** — Generates voiceover text and burns in subtitles
5. **Searches music** — Calls Trackyard skill: `search("upbeat travel music")`
6. **Downloads clips** — Calls Trackyard skill: `download(track_id, duration_seconds=15)`
7. **Merges audio+video** — Combines music with video
8. **Uploads** — Saves to Google Drive

**Result:** 5 fully produced videos, automatically created and delivered, twice a week.

## Simple Music Search

For one-off music searches when you're not automating a workflow.

### Example Conversation

```
You: "I need upbeat music for a product demo video"

OpenClaw: "Searching Trackyard for upbeat music..."

[Shows 5 results with titles, artists, moods, BPM]

You: "Download the third one as a 30-second clip"

OpenClaw: "Downloaded 'Digital Sunrise' (30s) → product_music.mp3"
```

## Batch Video Scoring

Score multiple videos with the same music style.

### The Workflow

"I have 10 videos in my 'Product Demos' folder. For each video:
1. Check the video duration
2. Search Trackyard for 'minimal electronic music for tech products'
3. Download a clip matching the exact video duration
4. Merge the music with the video
5. Save to 'Finished Videos' folder"

**OpenClaw handles:**
- Reading video durations automatically
- Searching Trackyard once, reusing the track
- Trimming music to match each video's length
- Batch processing all 10 videos

---

## Weekly Content Calendar

Create a recurring workflow for social media.

### The Schedule

**Monday 9am:**
"Create 3 Instagram Reels (15s each) about healthy recipes with chill background music"

**Wednesday 2pm:**
"Create 2 YouTube Shorts (30s each) about home workouts with energetic music"

**Friday 5pm:**
"Create 5 TikToks (60s each) about travel tips with upbeat music"

**What OpenClaw Does:**
- Runs automatically on schedule
- Generates content ideas
- Finds stock footage
- Searches Trackyard for appropriate music
- Creates final videos
- Saves to your content calendar folder

## A/B Testing Music Styles

Test which music style performs best for your content.

### The Workflow

"For my product demo video:
1. Search Trackyard for 3 different music styles: upbeat, minimal, and cinematic
2. Create 3 versions of the video (same visuals, different music)
3. Name them: demo_upbeat.mp4, demo_minimal.mp4, demo_cinematic.mp4
4. Save to my 'A/B Tests' folder"

**Result:** 3 video variants ready to test, created in one command.

---

## Podcast Intro Music

Find and apply background music for podcast episodes.

### The Workflow

"For each episode in my 'Podcast Episodes' folder:
1. Search Trackyard for 'professional background music for business podcast'
2. Download a 20-second clip
3. Add it as the intro music (fade in for 3 seconds, fade out for 2 seconds)
4. Save to 'Ready to Publish' folder"

## Tips for Building Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific with music queries" icon="bullseye">
    **Good:** "upbeat electronic music for tech product demo"
    
    **Bad:** "upbeat music"
    
    **Why:** Context helps Trackyard's AI find the right vibe.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reuse tracks across similar content" icon="recycle">
    If you're creating 10 videos with the same style, search once and reuse the track:
    
    "Search Trackyard for travel music, then use that track for all 10 videos with different durations"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Leverage smart trimming" icon="scissors">
    Instead of manually trimming music, let Trackyard do it:
    
    "Download as a 30-second clip" → OpenClaw passes `duration_seconds: 30` automatically
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with other skills" icon="puzzle-piece">
    The power of OpenClaw is combining skills:
    
    - **Pexels skill** → Find images
    - **Trackyard skill** → Find music
    - **Google Drive skill** → Save outputs
    - **Scheduler** → Automate recurring workflows
