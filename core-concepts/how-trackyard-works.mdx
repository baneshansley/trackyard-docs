title: "How Trackyard Works"
description: "The platform, catalog, and licensing model that powers instant music clearance at scale"
---

Trackyard is a music licensing platform built to solve the friction points in traditional music clearance workflows. Here's how it works.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional music licensing is slow and opaque:

- **Email negotiations** — Days or weeks of back-and-forth to get a quote
- **Hidden pricing** — No way to know what a track costs until you ask
- **Catalog bloat** — Thousands of tracks, most of which don't fit
- **Manual workflows** — Searching, shortlisting, and clearing tracks eats hours

Trackyard eliminates all of that.

---

## The Trackyard Approach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Curated Catalog">
    Tens of thousands of tracks, hand-selected for quality and versatility. Every track is:
    
    - **Professionally produced** — Human-led creation with AI-assisted workflows
    - **100% legally cleared** — Pre-cleared for social media, YouTube, podcasts, and online content
    - **Perpetually licensed** — No renewals, no expirations, no surprise fees
    
    No filler. No bloat. Just music that works.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI-Powered Discovery">
    Describe what you need in plain English. Trackyard's AI understands:
    
    - **Context** — "moody piano for a rainy scene" vs "sad music"
    - **Technical requirements** — BPM, key, duration, instrumentation
    - **Vibe matching** — Upload a temp track as a reference
    
    The search adapts to your workflow — whether you're a music supervisor browsing visually or a developer querying via API.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Transparent Pricing">
    Every track shows the price upfront. No sales calls, no email negotiations, no mystery.
    
    Pricing is based on usage tier:
    - **Online/Social** — Websites, YouTube, podcasts, social media
    - **Commercial** — Ads, branded content, paid placements
    - **Broadcast** — Film, TV, streaming (coming soon)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Instant Clearance">
    When you're ready, license instantly. The system:
    
    - Auto-generates the license agreement
    - Delivers the audio file (full track or smart-trimmed clip)
    - Updates your project records
    
    No waiting. No paperwork. No lawyers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Catalog

### Quality Over Quantity

Trackyard's catalog is **curated, not crowdsourced**. Every track is:

- **Reviewed for production quality** — Clean mixes, professional mastering
- **Tested for versatility** — Works across multiple use cases and platforms
- **Tagged with detailed metadata** — Genre, mood, BPM, key, instrumentation, energy level

We prioritize **findability** over raw track count. You want 10 great options, not 10,000 mediocre ones.

### Music Creation Process

<Accordion title="Human-Led. AI-Accelerated." icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
  Every track starts with a human artist or producer. AI assists with:
  
  - **Arrangement** — Generating variations and stems
  - **Production** — Speeding up mixing and mastering workflows
  - **Iteration** — Testing different moods, tempos, and instrumentation
  
  The result: more music, more variety, better pricing — without sacrificing quality.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Genre Coverage" icon="music">
  The catalog spans:
  
  - **Electronic** — House, techno, ambient, lo-fi, synthwave
  - **Hip Hop** — Boom bap, trap, lo-fi hip hop, instrumental beats
  - **Cinematic** — Orchestral, hybrid, trailer music, underscore
  - **Corporate** — Uplifting, minimal, professional background music
  - **Acoustic** — Folk, singer-songwriter, indie, Americana
  - **Classical** — String quartets, piano, chamber, baroque
  
  New tracks added weekly.
