Social media ads live or die on timing. The best ads sync music peaks to key moments — product reveals, logo drops, CTA screens. Trackyard's hit point alignment automates this sync perfectly.

---

## The Challenge

You're cutting a 15-second Instagram ad:
- Product appears at **8 seconds**
- Music should hit its peak **exactly** when the product enters the frame
- Traditional libraries require manual audio editing to align the hit

**Problem:** Manual alignment takes 5-10 minutes per ad variant. At scale, this doesn't work.

---

## The Trackyard Solution

Use `hit_point_seconds` to choreograph the music's climax to your reveal moment.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/download-track \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "track_id": "trk_abc123",
    "duration_seconds": 15,
    "hit_point_seconds": 8
  }' \
  --output ad_music.mp3
```

**What happens:**
1. Trackyard finds the dominant energy peak in the track (the biggest drop/hit/crescendo)
2. It selects a 15-second segment where that peak lands at exactly 8 seconds
3. You get a clip perfectly timed to your product reveal

**Zero manual editing.**

## Example: Product Reveal Ad

**Scenario:** 15-second Instagram Reel ad for a new sneaker

**Storyboard:**
- 0-7s: Product shots, building anticipation
- **8s: Sneaker reveal** ← music should peak here
- 9-15s: CTA + logo

**Request:**

```json
{
  "track_id": "trk_xyz789",
  "duration_seconds": 15,
  "hit_point_seconds": 8
}
```

**Result:** Music builds for 7 seconds, hits the peak right as the sneaker appears, then resolves into the CTA.

## Common Ad Formats

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Instagram Reels (15s)">
    **Typical structure:**
    - 0-7s: Setup/problem
    - **8s: Product reveal**
    - 9-14s: Benefits
    - 15s: CTA
    
    **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "duration_seconds": 15,
      "hit_point_seconds": 8
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="TikTok (60s)">
    **Typical structure:**
    - 0-10s: Hook
    - 11-40s: Story/demo
    - **41s: Reveal/climax**
    - 42-60s: CTA
    
    **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "duration_seconds": 60,
      "hit_point_seconds": 41
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="YouTube Pre-Roll (30s)">
    **Typical structure:**
    - 0-5s: Skippable timer
    - 6-20s: Value prop
    - **21s: Logo/brand moment**
    - 22-30s: CTA
    
    **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "duration_seconds": 30,
      "hit_point_seconds": 21
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## A/B Testing Ad Variants

Run the same ad with different music to test performance:

```python
# Search for different vibes
tracks = [
    search("upbeat electronic music"),
    search("warm acoustic music"),
    search("epic cinematic music"),
]

# Generate variants with the same timing
for i, track in enumerate(tracks):
    audio = download(
        track_id=track["id"],
        duration_seconds=15,
        hit_point_seconds=8  # Same reveal timing across variants
    )
    save(f"ad_variant_{i}.mp3", audio)
```

Test which vibe drives the highest CTR while keeping the visual edit identical.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose tracks with clear peaks" icon="chart-line">
    Electronic drops, orchestral crescendos, and hip hop hits work best.
    
    **Good candidates:**
    - EDM with build-ups and drops
    - Cinematic music with crescendos
    - Hip hop with bass hits
    
    **Less ideal:**
    - Ambient (no clear peaks)
    - Minimalist classical (subtle dynamics)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test hit point offsets" icon="clock">
    If the alignment feels slightly off, try adjusting ±1-2 seconds:
    
    ```json
    // Original
    {"hit_point_seconds": 8}
    
    // Try earlier
    {"hit_point_seconds": 7}
    
    // Try later
    {"hit_point_seconds": 9}
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch A/B test variants" icon="flask">
    Generate multiple music options upfront:
    
    1. Search for 5 different tracks
    2. Download each with the same `hit_point_seconds`
    3. Swap the audio track in your video editor
    4. Test all 5 variants simultaneously
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Align hit points to visual moments" icon="crosshairs">
    Best hit point placements:
    - Product reveals
    - Logo drops
    - Before-and-after transitions
    - CTA screens
    - Brand moments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Code Example: Multi-Platform Ad

Same video, different durations for each platform:

```python
platforms = [
    {"name": "instagram", "duration": 15, "reveal_at": 8},
    {"name": "tiktok", "duration": 60, "reveal_at": 35},
    {"name": "youtube", "duration": 30, "reveal_at": 18},
]

# Search once
track_id = search("upbeat music for tech product")["tracks"][0]["id"]

# Generate platform-specific clips
for platform in platforms:
    audio = download(
        track_id=track_id,
        duration_seconds=platform["duration"],
        hit_point_seconds=platform["reveal_at"]
    )
    save(f"ad_{platform['name']}.mp3", audio)
```
