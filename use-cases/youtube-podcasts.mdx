Podcasts and YouTube videos need background music that enhances without distracting. Trackyard's `energy: low` filter finds tracks that stay out of the way.

---

## The Use Case

Background music for:
- Podcast intros and outros
- YouTube tutorial voiceovers
- Talking head videos
- Interview shows
- Educational content

**Key requirement:** Music should be present but never compete with dialogue.

---

## The Solution

Search with `energy_level: "low"` to find ambient, non-intrusive tracks:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trackyard.com/api/external/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "background music for podcast",
    "filters": {
      "energy_level": "low",
      "has_vocals": false
    }
  }'
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **No vocals:** Vocal tracks compete with spoken dialogue. Always use `"has_vocals": false`
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Low energy:** Use `"energy_level": "low"` to ensure the music stays in the background
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Longer clips:** Podcasts and long-form videos benefit from full tracks or extended clips (2-3 minutes)
</Tip>
