## What Makes Trackyard Different

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Curated Catalog" icon="music">
    Tens of thousands of tracks, hand-selected for quality and versatility. No filler, no bloat — just music that works across film, TV, social media, podcasts, and digital content.
    
    Every track is 100% legally cleared with perpetual licenses. Clear it once, use it forever.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI-Powered Discovery" icon="sparkles">
    Describe what you need in plain English. Trackyard's AI understands context, mood, and scene requirements — surfacing tracks that actually fit, not just keyword matches.
    
    Upload a temp track as a reference, describe a vibe, or specify technical requirements. The search adapts to your workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instant Clearance" icon="bolt">
    Every track shows the price upfront. When you're ready, license instantly with auto-generated paperwork. No back-and-forth, no sales negotiations, no waiting.
    
    Perpetual licenses mean no renewals, no expirations, and no surprise fees down the road.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Clip Trimming" icon="scissors">
    Need a 30-second clip? Trackyard analyzes the waveform and selects the best-sounding segment automatically.
    
    Want the musical peak to hit at exactly 12 seconds? Use `hit_point_seconds` to choreograph every reveal to the beat.
